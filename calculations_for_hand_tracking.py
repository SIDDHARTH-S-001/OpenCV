# refer to this link for explanation https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-convert-camera-pixels-to-real-world-coordinates/
# in our case, frame height = 107 mm and frame width = 143 mm
# so coordinates to pixel conversion is as follows, for length to pixel ratio = 143/640 = 0.22343 (assuming pixels are sqaure)
